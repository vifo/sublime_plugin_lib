# sublime_plugin_lib

Python package providing additional functionality useful in [Sublime Text 2][ST2] as well as [Sublime Text 3][ST3] plug-in development.

Right now, there's nothing to see here, since this package has not been officially released yet. The curious and brave can have a peek at the [devel][devel_branch] branch containing alpha quality code.
